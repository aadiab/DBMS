** Case: DeadLock on delete-read operations (Transaction Mode):

** Command: .\myPTA.exe roundrobin 1000 100 DeadLock_Test\dr0.txt DeadLock_Test\dr1.txt DeadLock_Test\dr2.txt
** Scenario: 3 Transactions (T0, T1, T2), create a deadlock based on trying to delete and read, it is resolved by removing (T2).
** You can search "WFG", or "deadlock" to see the process before and after resolving the deadlock. 
** Below is the complete log for running the command above.
