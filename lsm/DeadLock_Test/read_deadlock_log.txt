** Case: Read Operations and DeadLocks (Transaction Mode):

** Command: .\myPTA.exe roundrobin 1000 100 DeadLock_Test\read0.txt DeadLock_Test\read1.txt DeadLock_Test\read2.txt
** Scenario: 3 Transactions (T0, T1, T2), read the same record over and over. But read do not conflict with each other, so no deadlock created and all transactions commit normally
** You can search "WFG", or "deadlock" to see the process before and after calling deadlock detection. 
** Below is the complete log for running the command above. 
** This is a demonstration of how to see deadlock in action, benchmarks will show more details and various scenarios
