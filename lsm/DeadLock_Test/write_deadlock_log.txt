** Case: Simple DeadLock between Write operations (Transaction Mode):

** Command: .\myPTA.exe roundrobin 1000 100 DeadLock_Test\write0.txt DeadLock_Test\write1.txt DeadLock_Test\write2.txt
** Scenario: 3 Transactions (T0, T1, T2), create a deadlock, and it is resolved by removing the last inserted (T2).
** You can search "WFG", or "deadlock" to see the process before and after resolving the deadlock. 
** Below is the complete log for running the command above. 
** This is a demonstration of how to see deadlock in action, benchmarks will show more details and various scenarios
