** BenchTest5: Delete operations with deadlock detected:
- The nature of this test is generally similar to TestBench3
- 10 Different transactions, they start with read ops, then a deadlock happens on Delete when each tries to delete the table another resource is holding.
- The following WFG is created:
	
	T0 -> T1 -> T2 -> T3 -> T4 -> T5 -> T6 -> T7 -> T8 -> T9 -> T0 
 
- The cycle of 11, starting from T0 and looping back, generates a deadlock.
- This deadlock is resolved by aborting one transaction, when it happens; the rest will perform normally.
