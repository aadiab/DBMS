Multiple Erase Erase Interactions

Expected: The first transaction has an erase lock on the file. All other transactions will wait in order until this erase lock is removed. So T0 Run first then T1 and so on and so forth. 
Actual: T0's first erase puts a lock on the record causing all other erases on this record id to be put on hold. Since these locks blocked the transactions, the blocked transaction's operations were put in a delayed list. Once the transaction was allowed to run again after T0 released it's locks, the later transactions were able to acquire locks to run all it's operations and commit. In the end, all operations ran in serial execution and no dirty reads.
