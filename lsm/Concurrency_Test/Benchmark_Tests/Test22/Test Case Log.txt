Multiple Write then Read then Write operations (Writes are transaction Reads are Processes)

Expected: The first transaction has a write lock on the file. Since T1 is a process it'll run its first operation and then release it's lock letting T2 run. T1 will then try to acquire it's locks but can't because T2 has the locks. 
Actual: All reads happen after a commit so no dirty reads are happening.
