Multiple Read Write Read Interactions (Transaction Process Interaction)

Expected: All the reads from the multiple transaction will run first then the writes will run. 
Actaul: Since reads are allowed to run in parallel and writes are blocked by reads, all the reads execute first then the writes execute. So what ever a transaction reads will be the same for multiple reads. T0's read request blocks P1's write request but allows T2's read request etc.
