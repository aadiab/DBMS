** This folder was provided to demonstrate the correct work of Statistics. It is meant to be done on small
examples to be able to actually count operations.

** Please note that this was done at the end after all other test cases. Which means the log of 
all other test cases MAY NOT contain the right stats.

** Also note that if you run any of thoses tests, you should get the correct stats (not the ones in log files).

- Thank You.
